    <h1>ROBOTS</h1>
    <h3>What Are Robots?</h3>
    <p>Robots are machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.Robots can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within.</p>
    <h3>Types Of Robots By Chronology</h3>
<p>In this case, up to five types of robots can be distinguished, in keeping with the stages that robotics has gone through until the present day.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First generation: robot manipulators

            These can pick up and move objects but they have very restricted movements.</li>
            <li>Second generation: learning robots

                These gather information from the environment to make more complex movements.</li>
                <li>Third generation: reprogrammable robots

                    These are equipped with sensors and they use programming languages to vary their functions in keeping with the needs of any given moment.</li>
                    <li>Fourth generation: mobile robots

                        The first intelligent robots capable of interpreting the environment in real time appear in the fourth generation.</li>
                        <li>Fifth generation: robots with artificial intelligence
                            This is the stage that’s currently under development. They’re intended to mimic human beings and they’re autonomous.</li>
                            </ol>

                             <h3>Importance of Robots</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Improved safety conditions for labor: </li>
                                <p> Robots have changed the structure of society and made work environments safer.</p>
                                <li>Military and space exploration:</li>
                                <p> Advanced robotics in the military and NASA have transformed national defense and space exploration.</p>
                                <li>Efficiency and precision: </li>
                                <p>Robots can perform actions without mistakes and faster than humans.</p>
                                <li>Automation:</li>
                                <p>Once programmed, robots can perform different tasks, replacing human labor for labor-intensive jobs.</p>
                            </ul>
